Waking, I checked to see if I was sick. I was too tired/groggy to do this effectively so abandoned the project and looked at the news. The news is not surprising and not fun. Did a m0nster box, closed a garbage bag. had a shower andput on coffee. Turning my oven up as high as it can go because the chemicals used to clean it are trying to kill me. 

Running low on good coffee. I have plenty of shit coffee, though. Today I might hunt down the places where dust has accumuulated over the past few years and clean. I also wanna learn more of jeckyll and git. And I should find a spell-check plging for vim because I can no longer spell.
