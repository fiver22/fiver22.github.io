First post.
I just cleaned my oven and now it's turned up to max to burn off whatever horrible chemicle I just spent an hour bathing in.
It stinks.


finally; got this working a bit better. That "i" in the title "ia first post" is me switching to insert mode in vim. leaving this as a lesson.

supper: pulled pork and pasta (stretching it out) on toast?... bread? probably bread.
